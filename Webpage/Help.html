      The Scramble for Africa, also called the Partition of Africa, or the
      Conquest of Africa, was the invasion, occupation, division, and
      colonization of most of Africa by seven Western European powers during a
      short period known to historians as the New Imperialism (between 1881 and
      1914). The 10 percent of Africa that was under formal European control in
      1870 increased to almost 90 percent by 1914, with only Ethiopia
      (Abyssinia) and Liberia remaining independent, though Ethiopia would later
      be invaded and occupied by Italy in 1936.

      Although it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's
      poorest and least-developed continent (other than Antarctica), the result
      of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have
      often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning,
      high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent
      tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).
      Its total nominal GDP remains behind that of the United States, China,
      Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, India and France. According to the
      United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked
      nations (151st to 175th) were all African.
