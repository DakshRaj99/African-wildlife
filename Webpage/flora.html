        <b><u>Hydnora africana</u></b>
        It is a plant native to southern Africa. It grows underground except for
        a fleshy flower that emerges from the ground. When the flower matures,
        it opens in three or four lobes of red color. These have villi on the
        edges, which give an exotic appearance similar to carnivorous plants.
        The hydnora africana emits a putrid smell to attract beetles and insects
        that will be responsible for pollination.
      </p>
