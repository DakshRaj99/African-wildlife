      <p class="text1">
        Africa is rich in the variety of fauna and, in its broader sense, is all
        the animals living in Africa and its surrounding seas and islands. The
        more characteristic African fauna is found in the Afrotropical realm.
        Lying almost entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south
        of the equator creates favourable conditions for rich wildlife. Africa
        is home to many of the world's most famous fauna in human culture such
        as lions‚ rhinoceros‚ cheetahs‚ giraffes‚ antelope, hippopotamus,
        leopards, zebras‚ and African elephants among many others.

      <p class="Insects">
        <b><u>Insects</u></b> - Approximately 100,000 species of insects have
        been described from Sub-Saharan Africa, but there are very few overviews
        of the fauna as a whole (it has been estimated that the African insects
        make up about 10-20% of the global insect species richness and about 15%
        of new species descriptions come from Afro tropics). The only endemic
        African insect order is Mantophasmatodea.The migratory locust and desert
        locust have been serious threats to African economies and human welfare.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="Butterflies">
        <b><u>Butterflies</u></b> - The butterflies include the Congolian
        forests and the Guinean forest-savannah mosaic. Some butterflies
        (Hamanumida Daedalus, Precis, Eurema) are grassland or savannah
        specialists. Many of these have a large population and a vast range.
        South Africa has one of the highest proportions of Lycaenid butterflies
        (48%) for any region around the Earth as there are many species
        restricted in range. North Africa is in the Palaearctic region and has a
        different species assemblage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="Marine_Wildlife">
        <b><u>Marine Wildlife</u></b> - Africa is a continent having the most
        varied Marine Wildlife. The East African Great Lakes (Victoria, Malawi,
        and Tanganyika) are the centre of biodiversity of many fish, especially
        cichlids (they harbour more than two-thirds of the estimated 2000
        species in the family). The West African coastal rivers region covers
        only a fraction of West Africa, but 322 harbours of West African’s fish
        species, with 247 restricted to this area and 129 restricted even to
        smaller ranges. The main rivers fauna comprises 194 fish species, with
        119 endemics and only 33 limited to the smaller surface. Although Africa
        has widely varied marine wildlife, the Indian Ocean has the most varied
        varieties of fishes and underwater organism.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="Reptitles">
        <b><u>Reptiles</u></b> - Africa is a continent that also excels in
        having a substantial variety of Reptiles on the Earth. Madagascar
        contains many kinds of reptiles in Africa. Of the lizards, many species
        of geckos and some monitor lizards are common. There are 12 genera and
        58 species of African amphibians. These include Snakes found in Africa
        include cobras, Python, Vipera and a much more variety of snakes. Many
        turtles, tortoises, snakes and crocodiles are seen.
      </p>
      <p class="Birds">
        <b><u>Birds</u></b> - There live more than 2600 bird species in Africa.
        The Afro tropic has various endemic bird families, including ostriches.
        Also, several families of passerines are limited to the Afro tropics.
        These include rock-jumpers, bush shrikes, wattle-eyes, and rock fowl.
        Other common species of birds include Parrots, Macaw, Cranes, Storks,
        Herons, Shoebills, Bustards, Sandgrouse etc.
      </p>
      <p class="Mammals">
        <b><u>Mammals</u></b> - More than 1100 mammal species live in Africa.
        Africa has three endemic orders of mammals, the Tubulidentata
        (aardvarks), Afrosoricida (tenrecs and golden moles), and Macroscelidea
        (elephant shrews). The current mammalian phylogeny recognizes the clade
        Afrotheria, which includes the exclusively African orders, as well as
        others believed to be of African origin. The East African plains are
        well known for their diversity of large mammals.
        <br />
        The African wildlife consists of many rare mammals which include: -
      </p>
      <p class="Lion">
        <b><u>Lion</u></b> - Lion is, as said the king of the Jungle. The lion
        indeed has a muscular figure, short-rounded face and is covered of hairs
        all around. Male lions are larger than females. The lion is an apex and
        keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur
        and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not. The
        lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, shrub lands and dry deciduous
        forests. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
        persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. It has
        been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because
        populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the
        early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected
        areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,
        habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for
        concern.
      </p>
      <p class="Rhino">
        <b><u>Rhinoceros</u></b> - Rhinoceroses are some of the largest
        remaining megafauna: all weigh at least one tonne in adulthood. They
        have a herbivorous diet, small brains (400–600 g) for mammals of their
        size, one or two horns, and a thick (1.5–5 cm), protective skin formed
        from layers of collagen. They generally eat leafy material, although
        their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on
        more fibrous plant matter when necessary. Rhinoceros are killed by some
        poachers for their horns, which are bought and sold on the black market,
        and used by people in some cultures for ornaments or traditional
        medicine. It was seen as a medicine in ancient China, a belief that was
        spread widely across to other Asian countries.
      </p>
      <p class="Cheetah">
        <b><u>Cheetah</u></b> - The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat
        native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal,
        estimated to be capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with
        the fastest reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61
        mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light
        build, long thin legs and a long tail. Its head is small and rounded,
        and has a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is
        typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with
        evenly spaced, solid black spots. The cheetah lives in three main social
        groups, females and their cubs, male "coalitions" and solitary males.
        While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home
        ranges, males are more sedentary and may instead establish much smaller
        territories in areas with plentiful prey. The cheetah is active mainly
        during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. It feeds on small- to
        medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40 kg (88 lb), and prefers
        medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and Thomson's gazelles.

      <p class="Giraffe">
        <b><u>Giraffe</u></b> - The giraffe is a tall African even-toed hoofed
        mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
        terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. The giraffe's chief
        distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its
        horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. Their food
        source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia
        species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot
        reach. Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs may prey
        upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their
        offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are
        gregarious and may gather in large aggregations.
